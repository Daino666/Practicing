Hi everyone,
 I'm Arwa Hassan. I'm thrilled to join the autonomous racing team. I've been fascinated by autonomous systems, ROS, and problem-solving for quite some time. Prior to joining the team, I had the opportunity to work with computer vision and problem-solving projects. When I'm not immersed in technology, I enjoy reading and exploring new sports. I'm eager to collaborate with all of you and contribute to our team's success in autonomous racing.
