My name is Alaa Nady, and I am 21 years old, currently residing in Assiut, Egypt. I am pursuing a degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering. I am actively involved in two technical teams: the Flight Team and the Motorsport Team, where I apply my engineering knowledge to real-world projects.

Additionally, I have a deep interest in autonomous systems, particularly in programming and controlling objects through code, which I found especially rewarding while working with the Autonomous Team. In my free time, I enjoy reading, with a particular passion for the works of Haruki Murakami.
